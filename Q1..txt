Q1.
Ans.These conditional statements are fundamental building blocks in programming that allow developers to control the flow of execution based on different conditions.
There are several types of conditional statements commonly used in programming:

1.if statement: The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
2.if...else if...else statement: The if...else if...else statement is used to execute different blocks of code for more than two conditions.

These conditional statements are powerful tools that allow you to create dynamic and responsive code, enabling your programs to adapt to different situations and make decisions based on specific conditions. They are essential for building robust and flexible software applications.
